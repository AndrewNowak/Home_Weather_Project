# Home_Weather_Project

This project is intended to use a Raspberry Pi as home weather monitoring station. The hardware for this project is as follows:

  Raspberry Pi 3A+
  BME 680 temperature, pressure, humidity, adn gas sensor from Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660?gclid=CjwKCAjwrqqSBhBbEiwAlQeqGpHX7byrw4KyuOao_qE62qWI4WT8NkpTrZ9w8Js1u7spb5OjhsyJURoCoKUQAvD_BwE)
  Reflective IR Optical sensor from Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2349)
  Home 3D printed housing and parts
  
This project is still in the beginning phases. The housing and anemeometer parts have yet to be designed and printed, but file attachements will uploaded when completed,
along with a complete circuit diagram for wiring.

The BME680 and IR sensros have been tested to work with the Raspberry Pi, however, a complete software package has yet to be fully designed and tested. 
Much of the inspiration for design and software, especially related to the anemometer, is inspired by the Youtube channel ExplainingComputers 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPEPZ02-t8&t=485s)

The current software uploaded is a preliminary version of the final software that has yet to be tested with the BME680 sensor and IR anemometer in conjunction. 
Testing for this is planeed to happen soon so that any bugs may be fixed. It should also be menitoned that there is no outlet yet for this data to be easily read
and utilized.
After all testing and design is complete, the hope is to be able to upload at least some of this data to the Weather Underground website.

Future considerations for this project hope to include an automatic rain gauge to accurately report precipitation, and a live camera feed to record any anomalous happenings.
