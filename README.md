# Home_Weather_Project

This project is intended to use a Raspberry Pi as home weather monitoring station. The hardware for this project is as follows:

  -Raspberry Pi 3A+
  -BME 680 temperature, pressure, humidity, adn gas sensor from Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3660?gclid=CjwKCAjwrqqSBhBbEiwAlQeqGpHX7byrw4KyuOao_qE62qWI4WT8NkpTrZ9w8Js1u7spb5OjhsyJURoCoKUQAvD_BwE)
  -Reflective IR Optical sensor from Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2349)
  -Home 3D printed housing and parts
  -QILIPSU weatherproof jucntion box

Much of the inspiration for design and software, especially related to the anemometer, is inspired by the Youtube channel ExplainingComputers 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPEPZ02-t8&t=485s)
Additionally, information on uploading data to Weather Underground was excellently explained from the tutorial at the following liik: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/uploading-weather-data-to-weather-underground


Future considerations for this project hope to include an automatic rain gauge to accurately report precipitation, and a UV sensor.
